# IoT-Based-LPG-Cylinder-monitoring-system
B.Tech Final Year Project


Aim: 
To monitor for liquid petroleum gas (LPG) leakage to avoid major fire accidents and also facilitating safety precautions where security has been an important issue and monitoring and analyse the uses of your LPG cylinder.
To automatically book a cylinder if weight of the cylinder goes below the threshold level. 

Solution:
This project has an effective & affirmative way of monitoring the gas quantity in the container via a message by means of internet through an IoT module.
The system detects the leakage of LPG using gas sensor and alerts the consumer about the gas leakage by sending an SMS. 
This system is also designed to detect LPG gases such as propane and butane. 
The allowed level for butane is 600ppm, above which it is considered to be dangerously high. 
The current weight of the gas cylinder is checked using a Load Cell. 


Future Scope:
It can be part of any smart home automation ecosystem.
It can be used in industries and hotels for monitoring gas pipelines.
Easy sync with Cooking Robots.
Extend functionality to identify leakages and also take further steps.
